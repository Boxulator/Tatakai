-Notifier and esp if advance or lightning has spawned. 
-Auto Perfect Block with combat equipped. (15 studs distance)

-New Special items (Books/Canes/GoldenGift) esp and notifier **YOU HAVE TO LOOK AROUND THE MAP AND BE NEAR THEM IN ORDER FOR THEM TO SPAWN**
-Stand in front of a punching bag and manually equip gloves while AutoSpar is activated and it will do the rest for you.

Accept a job first before using AutoJob. (Automatically deposits 2k. 2m is max bank)
AutoSparring/AutoRoadwork will auto eat chickens/burgers/shakes. 
Double ww and let go for inf run animation for AutoRoadwork. (**STAND NEAR GYM ENTRANCE WITHOUT ONGOING ROADWORK BEFORE DOING AUTOROADWORK. YOU ALSO HAVE TO USE IY AUTOCLICK.**)
Character may or may not get glitched when using M to Reset or turning off AutoJob/AutoImpact but ignores combat tag. (Game doesnt load character correctly when respawn recommend waiting for 30 seconds or more before rejoining/leaving)
